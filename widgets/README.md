### Widgets

**Concept**: Widgets are codes that combine lower layers to create comprehensive, interactive blocks with data.

**Self-Check Question**:

- When looking at the interface from a distance, do these elements stand out as independent "blocks"?

**Example**:

- A **list of posts with pagination** and the **application's header** are distinct blocks within the interface.

This section emphasizes the importance of creating distinct, functional units in the application's interface that are both interactive and data-driven.
